* Socket Interface: UDP
Create a socket, allocates OS-assigned port number and buffer
Other families: AF_INET6, AF_UNIX
    ~socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)~

Associate a specific local address and port number with the socket
    ~bind((host_addr, port))~

Send a data-gram containing the indicated bytes to indicated destination
    ~sendto(data, (host_addr, port)) -> count~

Receive a data-gram along with the (host_addr, port) of its sender
    ~recvfrom(buffersize) -> (data, (host_addr, port))~

* Socket Interface: TCP Client [not done]
Create a socket, allocates OS-assigned port number and buffer
Other families: AF_INET6, AF_UNIX
    ~socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)~


Attempt to establish a connection with a remote socket and associate
Associate a specific local address and port number with the socket
    ~bind((host_addr, port))~

Send a data-gram containing the indicated bytes to indicated destination
    ~sendto(data, (host_addr, port)) -> count~

Receive a data-gram along with the (host_addr, port) of its sender
    ~recvfrom(buffersize) -> (data, (host_addr, port))~

* Socket Interface: TCC Server [not done]
